# Sentiment-Analysis-On-Restaurant-Review
This project looked at the Sentiment Analysis using Data Science and Machine Learning.

The applications of sentiment analysis are broad and powerful. 

The ability to extract insights from social data is a practice that is being widely adopted by organisations across the world.

My motive is to determine the feedback of a customer,whether is it a negative feedback [0] or positive feedback [1].

# Packages and Libraries 
1. NLTK - The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language.NLTK is intended to support research and teaching in NLP or closely related areas, including empirical linguistics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and machine learning.NLTK supports classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning functionalities.

2. Pandas - In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.Pandas is mainly used for data analysis. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel. Pandas allows various data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting, as well as data cleaning, and data wrangling features. 

3. Sklearn - Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, K-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

4. Matplotlib - Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged. SciPy makes use of Matplotlib.
